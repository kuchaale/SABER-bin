# SABER-bin
Using python langualage, in particular xarray, for generating latitude-altitude gridded data from SABER instrument. Your feedback is highly appreciated. The script is following an approach from [http://home.uni-leipzig.de/jacobi/docs/2009_LIM_1.pdf](Using Python language for analysing measurements from SABER instrument on TIMED satellite). Using xarray, however, we are able to reach significant speed-up in binning.
